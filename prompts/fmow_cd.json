"toll_booth": [
"Appears as small, uniform structures aligned in a row across roadways, often at strategic points like bridges or highway exits.",
"Each booth is typically equipped with a canopy, visible as a rectangular or elongated shade structure in satellite imagery.",
"Roads leading to and from the booths show widening or branching patterns, indicating multiple lanes converging into toll collection points.",
"Adjacent to the booths, you can usually see lanes demarcated by road markings, organizing the flow of traffic into orderly queues.",
"The area often includes barriers or gates, visible as thin lines perpendicular to traffic flow, used to control vehicle passage.",
"In many cases, adjacent parking or waiting areas are noticeable, serving as holding zones for trucks and maintenance vehicles."
],

"tower": [
"Appears as a slender, vertical structure rising prominently above the surrounding landscape or cityscape in satellite images.",
"Often casts a long, narrow shadow that can help indicate its height and shape during different times of the day.",
"Typically cylindrical or polygonal in shape, with a uniform or tapering width visible from aerial views.",
"The top of the tower may feature antennas, spires, or other protrusions, making it distinct from other high-rise buildings.",
"Surfaces are sometimes segmented or patterned, reflecting different materials or structural elements.",
"Isolated from other tall structures, towers stand out as solitary points in less dense environments or as notable landmarks in urban areas."
],

"tunnel_opening": [
"Visible as a dark, circular or rectangular shape that interrupts the continuity of a road or railway line in satellite imagery.",
"Often flanked by protective barriers or retaining walls that appear as linear structures on either side of the opening.",
"Surrounded by disturbed earth or landscaping changes, indicating excavation sites during the tunnel's construction.",
"The entrance can sometimes be identified by shadows cast into the tunnel, making the opening appear darker than its surroundings.",
"Located typically at the base of mountains, hillsides, or beneath urban infrastructure to facilitate transportation routes.",
"May show signs of support structures like beams or columns near the opening, visible as small geometric patterns."
],


"waste_disposal": [
"Looks like large areas with many different colors, showing mixed waste materials.",
"The ground is rough and patchy, with visible heaps of trash.",
"Each heap has its own look and color, from things like food waste, building debris, or metal scraps.",
"There's little to no grass or plants, mostly just dirt or packed-down earth.",
"Shiny objects like metal can make bright spots in the pictures from satellites.",
"You can often see machines like bulldozers or compactors, which are small and easy to spot."
],

"water_treatment_facility": [
"Typically shows large, circular tanks that are often arranged in clusters, visible as distinct geometric shapes.",
"Features rectangular pools or basins that are usually lined up in series, noticeable from above for their clear, straight edges.",
"The site often includes buildings with flat roofs, smaller in size compared to the tanks and pools.",
"Visible piping or walkways may connect between the tanks and pools, appearing as thin, linear marks.",
"The overall layout is organized and symmetrical, with facilities structured in a grid or parallel arrangement.",
"Surfaces of water bodies within the facility can appear darker or have a different texture compared to natural water bodies."
],

"wind_farm": [
"Characterized by multiple tall, thin structures with three-bladed turbines atop, uniformly spaced in rows or clusters.",
"The turbines are typically white or light-colored, making them stand out against natural landscapes in satellite images.",
"Visible access roads connect the turbines, appearing as narrow, linear paths that weave through the farm.",
"Each turbine casts a distinct shadow that aligns with the sun's position, creating consistent linear patterns on the ground.",
"The layout of the turbines often follows the topography, adapting to hills or ridges to maximize wind exposure.",
"In coastal or offshore settings, turbines appear as isolated points on the water, connected by submerged lines seen as faint trails."
],

"zoo": [
"Displays a variety of enclosure shapes and connecting pathways, which may appear more formal and structured in urban settings and more blended with the natural landscape in rural or less developed areas.",
"In regions such as Africa, zoos often integrate subtly with the surrounding environment, featuring enclosures that are less distinctly defined and more natural in appearance.",
"Visible landscaping within enclosures includes elements like simulated water bodies and diverse vegetation patches to recreate natural habitats.",
"The pathways, clear from above, typically meander through the zoo, connecting various animal habitats with smooth, winding lines.",
"Large open spaces, noticeable from aerial views, are used for animal grazing or as gathering spaces for visitors, often delineated by fences or natural borders.",
"Parking areas, when present, are usually expansive and located near the main entrances, clearly segmented from the rest of the zoo layout."
